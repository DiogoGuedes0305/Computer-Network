RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 2 planning===========================================### Sprint master: 1170878 #### 1. Sprint's backlog #- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every membersï¿½ Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation. -1181585- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 2, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170727- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 3, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170617- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 4, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170878- Fixe issues from last sprint# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.  * Backbone cable types to be used		Copper cables (CAT6A) between the CP's and between CP's and HC's. Multimode Optic Fiber cables between HC's and IC's and between the IC's and the MC and between HC's and AP's.    * VLAN IDs to be used		Default VLAN is the VLAN with ID 1.		The range of VLAN IDs go from 365 to 395.		The team as dicide to use the following templete for the VLAN names													        	X_Y		X Building		Y VLAN name   * VTP domains		 rcompdng1	  * IPv4 networks' addresses and routers' addresses		IPV4 adresses strats at 10.126.240.0/20 			ISP router IPv4 node address  is 120.57.201.241/30* Devices naming		The team as dicide to use the following templete for the devices names 		 												X_Y_FloorZ_W  	X Building 	Y Devices 	Z Floor	W Number of the Device  * Routing protocols  * Application protocols outlining (further coordination may be required between members)# 3. Subtasks assignment #(For each team member (sprint master included), the description of the assigned subtask in sprint 2)#### Example: ######## The Vlans were distributed in the following manner:####  * 1181585 - Building 1. Vlan[365-369], Campus Vlan[385];  * 1170727 - Building 2. Vlan[370-374];  * 1170617 - Building 3. Vlan[375-379];  * 1170878 - Building 4.
