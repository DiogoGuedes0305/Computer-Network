RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 2 review=========================================### Sprint master: 1170878 #### 1. Sprint's backlog # - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every membersï¿½ Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation. -1181585- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 2, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170727- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 3, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170617- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 4, and also encompassing the campus backbone.-1170878- Fixe issues from last sprint# 2. Subtasks assessment #One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:  * Totally implemented with no issues  * Totally implemented with issues  * Partially implemented with no issues  * Partially implemented with issuesFor the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.(Examples)## 2.1. 1181585 - Structured cable design and VLAN devices configuration and IPv4 addressing and routing for building 1, floors 0 and 1 and Campus #Totally implemented with no issues## 2.2. 1170727- Structured cable design and VLAN devices configuration and IPv4 addressing and routing for building 2, floors 0 and 1 and Campus # Totally implemented with no issues## 2.3. 1170617- Structured cable design and VLAN devices configuration and IPv4 addressing and routing for building 3, floors 0 and 1 and Campus #Totally implemented with no issues. ## 2.4. 1170878-Structured cable design and VLAN devices configuration and IPv4 addressing and routing for building 4, floors 0 and 1 and Campus #Totally implemented with no issues.
